# Dinner

- [La Loba](https://goo.gl/maps/f7fjxFTuSXo9YS8N8)
  - Spanish Tapas bar
  - Wide selection for tapas and some wines, each dish/drink is affordable, high-quality.
- [Bori](https://goo.gl/maps/7kWmZX7kfWTgu45M7)
  - Korean restaurant
  - Small place, can be hard to find a table for more than 4 people
  - Bibimbap is my favorite dish there.
- [Pizzeria Papi](https://goo.gl/maps/6EBW2dhEvvrQ5HgF7)
  - Italian restaurant
  - Music is little too loud, not recommended if you want to discuss deep philosophical topics with your friends
  - Very good pizza, large portion, one pizza is enough to feed two Japanese people
- [YEnat](https://goo.gl/maps/55CwTc3DPeAgmKk77)
  - Ethiopian restaurant
  - I don’t know their main dish is called but it’s very good and recommended for a nice small group gathering.
